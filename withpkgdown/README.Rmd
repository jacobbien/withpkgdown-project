# withpkgdown: A Package With a README, Vignette, and Pkgdown Site <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" />

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package's purpose is to show how to use `litr` to create a package with a README, a vignette, a `pkgdown`, and (of course) a hex sticker.  We can see the result of all of that at this package's website [here](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jacob-bien/withpkgdown/docs/index.html).

## Getting started

You can install `withpkgdown` and get started like so:

```{r}
remotes::install_github("jacobbien/withpkgdown-project", subdir = "withpkgdown")
```
